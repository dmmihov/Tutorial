Project description:
We intend to create a computer game, that scrolls the screen from left to right, with a character, that moves up the screen, while clicking the mouse, and moves down the screen, when no action is taken. The concept is for the character to have obstacles to avoid in it’s path. We will decompose the task into three parts, with a forth one pending on the first three. One is to make the screen move from the left to the right, another is to make the obstacles appear randomly on the screen and the third one is to make the character interact with the clicking of the mouse and with the obstacles. The forth one will be a modification of the code, that allows the player to proceed to different “levels” of the game, trough a counter, that measures the distance that the player has reached and make the speed of the screen scrolling faster and after testing, to make the game more challenging if needed, to also make obstacles more common if the game needs balancing.
